# YubiKey 5.8 Quickstarts for iOS/macOS

iOS/macOS Code/project samples demonstrating features of the YubiKey 5.8, using the [Yubico Swift SDK](https://github.com/Yubico/yubikit-swift/).

## 🛠 Prerequisites

| Requirement | Details |
|---|---|
| Yubico Swift SDK | Release 1.3.0 or later ([download](https://github.com/Yubico/yubikit-swift/releases/tag/v1.3.0)) |
| YubiKey | Firmware 5.8 or later. |
| FIDO2 PIN | A PIN must be set on the YubiKey to run most of these examples. You can do this in the YubiKey Authenticator, available on the [macOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yubico-authenticator/id1497506650?mt=12) |
| Xcode ([latest](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)) | For building and running the quickstart examples/demos on a realy iOS device or mac running macOS |

## Quickstarts
A few of the quickstarts below share the same sample project (`WebAuthnInterceptorSample`) that is an iOS/macOS app with an embedded WKWebView that allows you to interact with some of the newer features via the web and the YubiKey 5.8 like preview signing, prf, and others.

### PreviewSign (Browswer-based Signing Preview)

The `previewSign` extension is a [proposed WebAuthn extension](https://yubicolabs.github.io/webauthn-sign-extension/4/#sctn-sign-extension) that supports hardware-backed ECDSA P-256 signing over application-defined data.

- `previewSign`

[README](previewSign/README.md) &#183; [Code](WebAuthnInterceptorSample/WebAuthnInterceptorSample/WebAuthnHandler.swift)


---

### ARKGPreviewSign (Native macOS/iOS App)

ARKGPreviewSign is a standalone native macOS/iOS app that demonstrates The `previewSign` extension with ARKG key generaion and hardware-backed ECDSA P-256 signing.

- `ARKGPreviewSign`

[README](ARKGPreviewSign/README.md)

---

### device-identity (PPUAT - Persistent PIN UV Auth Token)

Implements PPUAT acquisition with PCMR permission, `encIdentifier` decryption, `encCredStoreState` decryption and cross-session token reuse. These are the primitives that support conditional mediation for hardware security keys.

- Persistent PIN UV Auth Token (PPUAT)
- Persistent Credential Management Read Only (PCMR)
- `encIdentifier`
- `encCredStoreState`

#### README <COMING SOON>(COMING SOON)
---

### third-party-payments
Creates a payment credential with thirdPartyPayment, locks it down with credProtect so every use requires PIN or biometric and stores a card label on the key with credBlob. Then runs a simulated merchant checkout.

- `thirdPartyPayment`
- `credBlob`
- `credProtect`
#### README <COMING SOON>(COMING SOON)
---

### yubikey-management (getInfo mostly and pin management)

- #### FIDO over CCID 
    CTAP commands transported over ISO 7816 / USB CCID Handled at the platform layer; the Yubico iOS Swift SDK utilizes the CCID transport by default when available.

- #### GetInfo discovery

    Reads AuthenticatorInfo fields supported in firmware 5.8. No credentials are created and no PIN or touch is needed.
    - `maxPINLength`
    - `pinComplexityPolicy`
    - `pinComplexityPolicyURL`
    - `uvCountSinceLastPinEntry`
    - `attestationFormats`
    - `transportsForReset`
    - `longTouchForReset`
